<p>Over 12.000 users voted for Europe‘s biggest public award<br /><br />For about two weeks European gamers were able to vote online for the best European games, developers, publishers, magazines and platforms on this website. More than 12.000 games-fans from more than 30 countries registered for voting. The winners were honored on 14th August 2010 during the award ceremony on the event ship ‘Pure-liner 1’ in Cologne.<br /><br />The award-giving ceremony was embedded into an innovative show concept with interviews, laudats or video broadcasts. Laudatory speeches were held, amongst others, by Bob Bates, Chris Taylor, CEO of Gas Powered Games, and Nils-Holger Henning from Bigpoint. Viola Tensil – well-known for GIGA and Germany’s only female presenter with games specialization, led through the evening.  The evening’s music was provided by André Herbst, co-founder of Acony, as DJ. A large farewell-firework on the Rhine waterfront was the event’s visual highlight. Leading games industry representatives such as DICE, Electronic Arts und Ubisoft belonged to the more than 250 guests, as well as representatives from German companies such as dtp entertainment, Daedalic and Bigpoint.</p></td>
